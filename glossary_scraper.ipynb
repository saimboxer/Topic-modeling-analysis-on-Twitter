The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or <em>anthropogenic</em> origin. Aerosols may influence <em>climate</em> in several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces thereby altering their <em>albedo</em> and contributing to <em>climate feedback</em>. Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous <em>precursors</em>. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, <em>black carbon (BC),</em> mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium. These labels are, however, imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures.

Originally proposed in the Earth System science community in 2000, the proposed new epoch is undergoing a formalization process within the geological community based on the stratigraphic <em>evidence</em> that human activities have changed the Earth System to the extent of forming geological deposits with a signature that is distinct from those of the <em>Holocene</em>, and which will remain in the geological record. Both the stratigraphic and Earth System approaches to defining the Anthropocene consider the mid-20th Century to be the most appropriate starting date, although others have been proposed and continue to be discussed. The Anthropocene concept has been taken up by a diversity of disciplines and the public to denote the substantive influence humans have had on the state, dynamics and future of the Earth System.

These include enhancing biological <em>sinks</em> of <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> and using chemical engineering to achieve long-term removal and storage. <em>Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</em> from industrial and energy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, can reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> if it is combined with <em>bioenergy</em> production (<em>BECCS</em>).

In the context of <em>transformation pathways</em>, the term baseline scenarios refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation <em>policies</em> or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to <em>mitigation scenarios</em> that are constructed to meet different goals for <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term baseline scenario is often used interchangeably with reference scenario and no policy scenario.

The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind.

Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external <em>forcings</em> such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent <em>anthropogenic</em> changes in the composition of the <em>atmosphere</em> or in <em>land use</em>. Note that the <em>Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</em>, in its Article 1, defines climate change as: \\xe2\\x80\\x98a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

See also <em>Climate change</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) emission</strong></p>\\n<p>The amount of <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> emission that would cause the same integrated <em>radiative forcing</em> or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon.

Two main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional <em>climate models</em>, global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods are based on observations and develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/regional <em>climate</em> variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on quality of the downscaled information. The two methods can be combined, e.g., applying empirical/statistical downscaling to the output of a regional climate model, consisting of a dynamical downscaling of a global climate model.</p>\\n<p><strong>Drought</strong></p>\\n<p>A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular precipitation-related activity that is under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop production or <em>ecosystem</em> function in general (due to <em>soil moisture</em> drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the <em>runoff</em> and percolation season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in</p>\\n<p>precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as a meteorological drought.

Dependent upon context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/or <em>Indigenous knowledge</em>. EWS are also considered for ecological applications e.g., conservation, where the organization itself is not threatened by hazard but the <em>ecosystem</em> under conservation is (an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (for example, warnings of ground frost, hailstorms) and in fisheries (storm and tsunami warnings).

The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment.

These are frequently classified as (1) supporting services such as productivity or <em>biodiversity</em> maintenance, (2) provisioning services such as food or fibre, (3) regulating services such as climate regulation or <em>carbon sequestration</em>, and (4) cultural services such as tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Effective climate sensitivity</strong></p>\\n<p>See <em>Climate sensitivity</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Effective radiative forcing</strong></p>\\n<p>See <em>Radiative forcing</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>El Ni\\xc3\\xb1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong></p>\\n<p>The term El Ni\\xc3\\xb1o was initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere\\xe2\\x80\\x93ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Ni\\xc3\\xb1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the <em>sea surface temperatures</em> in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections.

A cap on <em>GHG</em> emissions is divided in tradeable emission permits that are allocated by a combination of auctioning and handing out free allowances to entities within the jurisdiction of the trading scheme. Entities need to surrender emission permits equal to the amount of their emissions (e.g., tonnes of <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em>). An entity may sell excess permits to entities that can avoid the same amount of emissions in a cheaper way. Trading schemes may occur at the intra-company, domestic, or international level (e.g., the flexibility mechanisms under the <em>Kyoto Protocol</em> and the EU-ETS) and may apply to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), other greenhouse gases (GHGs), or other substances.</p>\\n<p><strong>Enabling conditions </strong></p>\\n<p>Conditions that affect the <em>feasibility</em> of <em>adaptation</em> and <em>mitigation</em> options, and can accelerate and scale-up systemic transitions that would limit temperature increase to 1.5\\xc2\\xb0C and enhance capacities of systems and societies to adapt to the associated <em>climate change</em>, while achieving <em>sustainable development</em>, eradicating <em>poverty</em> and reducing <em>inequalities</em>. Enabling conditions include finance, technological innovation, strengthening <em>policy</em> instruments, <em>institutional capacity</em>, <em>multilevel governance</em>, and changes in <em>human behaviour</em> and lifestyles.

Energy efficiency is often described by energy intensity. In economics, energy intensity describes the ratio of economic output to energy input. Most commonly energy efficiency is measured as input energy over a physical or economic unit, i.e., kWh USD<sup>-1</sup> (energy intensity), kWh tonne<sup>-1</sup>. For buildings, it is often measured as kWh m<sup>-2</sup>, and for vehicles as km liter<sup>-1</sup> or liter km<sup>-1</sup>.

Variation of the results across the ensemble members may give an estimate of modelling-based <em>uncertainty</em>. Ensembles made with the same model but different initial conditions only characterize the uncertainty associated with internal <em>climate variability</em>, whereas multimodel ensembles including simulations by several models also include the impact of model differences. Perturbed parameter ensembles, in which model parameters are varied in a systematic manner, aim to assess the uncertainty resulting from internal model specifications within a single model. Remaining sources of uncertainty unaddressed with model ensembles are related to systematic model errors or biases, which may be assessed from systematic comparisons of model simulations with observations wherever available.

The traditional radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative forcing. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.</p>\\n<p><strong>Reasons for Concern (RFCs)</strong></p>\\n<p>Elements of a classification framework, first developed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, which aims to facilitate judgments about what level of <em>climate change</em> may be dangerous (in the language of Article 2 of the <em>UNFCCC</em>) by aggregating\\xc2\\xa0<em>risks</em> from various sectors, considering <em>hazards</em>, <em>exposures</em>, <em>vulnerabilities</em>, capacities to adapt, and the resulting <em>impacts</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) </strong></p>\\n<p>An effort to create financial value for the carbon stored in <em>forests</em>, offering incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions from forested lands and invest in low-carbon paths to <em>sustainable development (SD)</em>. It is therefore a mechanism for <em>mitigation</em> that results from avoiding <em>deforestation</em>. REDD+ goes beyond deforestation and forest degradation, and includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The concept was first introduced in 2005 in the 11th Session of the <em>Conference of the Parties (COP)</em> in Montreal and later given greater recognition in the 13th Session of the COP in 2007 at Bali and inclusion in the Bali Action Plan, which called for \\xe2\\x80\\x98policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD) and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stock in developing countries.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Since then, support for REDD has increased and has slowly become a framework for action supported by a number of countries.</p>\\n<p><strong>Reference period</strong></p>\\n<p>The period relative to which <em>anomalies</em> are computed.

Sea ice concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer.

Global mean sea level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent (SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and its distribution.</p>\\n<p><strong>Sea surface temperature (SST)</strong></p>\\n<p>The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys, and drifters.

These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial time scales, and so their effect on <em>climate</em> is predominantly in the first decade after their emission, although their changes can still induce long-term climate effects such as <em>sea level change</em>.

Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous <em>precursors</em>. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, <em>black carbon (BC),</em> mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium.

Note that the <em>Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</em>, in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.’ The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

       "<p>The term El Niño was initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere–ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the <em>sea surface temperatures</em> in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Niña.</p>\n",

The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or <em>anthropogenic</em> origin. Aerosols may influence <em>climate</em> in several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces thereby altering their <em>albedo</em> and contributing to <em>climate feedback</em>. Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous <em>precursors</em>. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, <em>black carbon (BC),</em> mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium. These labels are, however, imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures. See also<em> Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF)</em> and <em>Black carbon (BC)</em>.</p>\n",

It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the <em>sea surface temperatures</em> in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific.

       " <p>The Paris Agreement under the <em>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</em> was adopted on December 2015 in Paris, France, at the 21st session of the <em>Conference of the Parties (COP)</em> to the UNFCCC. The agreement, adopted by 196 Parties to the UNFCCC, entered into force on 4 November 2016 and as of May 2018 had 195 Signatories and was ratified by 177 Parties. One of the goals of the Paris Agreement is ‘Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Additionally, the Agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement is intended to become fully effective in 2020.
